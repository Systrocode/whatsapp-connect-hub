# Task Completion Report: Zendesk Logo Update

## Objective
Replace the PayTabs placeholder in the Integrations Ecosystem with the official Zendesk logo (`zendesk.svg`), and update the mobile grid configuration to include Zendesk.

## Changes Implemented
- **Zendesk Node**: Replaced the PayTabs (blue dot) placeholder with the `zendesk.svg` image in the desktop absolute positioning layout (top-left).
- **Mobile Grid**: Added a new entry for Zendesk in the mobile integration list, ensuring it appears on smaller screens as well.
- **Visuals**: The Zendesk logo is now presented in a large, centered white bubble card, matching the established design system.

## Verification
- **Visual Check**: Confirmed via screenshot (`zendesk_logo_verification`) that the Zendesk logo is correctly displayed in the top-left position of the ecosystem visual, replacing the previous placeholder.
