# Task Completion Report: Ready for Logo Replacement

## Status
The Ad Card layout has been aligned correctly. The "G" text logo is identified in the code (`Index.tsx`, around line 434) and is ready to be replaced.

## Next Steps
- Waiting for the user to upload the new logo image.
- Once uploaded, I will replace the `<div className="...">G</div>` implementation with an `<img />` tag referencing the new asset.
