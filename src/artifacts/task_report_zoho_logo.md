# Task Completion Report: Zoho Logo Update

## Objective
Update the Zoho integration node in the Integrations Ecosystem section to use the official logo file (`zoho.svg`) following the user's upload.

## Changes Implemented
- **Zoho Node**: Replaced the placeholder red dot with the `zoho.svg` image in the desktop layout.
- **Mobile Grid**: Updated the mobile configuration for Zoho to reference the new logo path.

## Verification
- **Visual Check**: Confirmed via screenshot (`zoho_logo_verification_final`) that the Zoho logo (colorful wordmark blocks) is correctly displayed and centered in its bubble card within the left-hand column, consistent with the other updated integrations.
