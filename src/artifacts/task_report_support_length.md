# Task Completion Report: Increased Content Length for Support Section

## Objective
Add additional visual content to the right column of the Support Section to match the vertical length of the left column (text content), filling the empty space identified by the user.

## Changes Implemented
- **New Visual Elements Added**:
    1.  **Metric Cards**: Added two data-driven insight cards below the chat mockup:
        -   **CSAT Score**: Displays "4.9" with a progress bar.
        -   **Reply Time**: Displays "45s" with a "12% improvement" trend indicator.
    2.  **Team Status Bar**: Added a "Team Inbox Active" bar with agent avatars (`AG`) and a pulsing online indicator.
- **Placement**: These elements are stacked directly below the existing Chat Mockup in the right column grid.

## Verification
- **Visual Check**: A verification screenshot (`support_section_verification_...`) shows the new cards and team bar successfully rendered.
- **Outcome**: The visual column now extends downwards to meaningful align with the "Stats Row" of the text column, creating a fully balanced, professional section layout as requested.
