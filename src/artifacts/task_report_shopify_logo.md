# Task Completion Report: Shopify Logo Update

## Objective
Update the Shopify integration node in the Integrations Ecosystem section to use the official logo file (`shopify-logo.svg`) following the user's upload.

## Changes Implemented
- **Shopify Node**: Replaced the placeholder green dot with the `shopify-logo.svg` image in the desktop absolute positioning layout.
- **Mobile Grid**: Updated the mobile configuration for Shopify to reference the new logo path, ensuring consistency across devices.

## Verification
- **Visual Check**: Confirmed via screenshot (`shopify_logo_verification`) that the Shopify logo (green shopping bag) is correctly displayed and centered within its large white bubble card.
