# Task Completion Report: Footer Badge Removal

## Objective
Remove the G2 award badges (Leader, Momentum, High Performer, etc.) from the newly redesigned footer as per the user's latest request.

## Changes Implemented
- **Deleted G2 Badges Section**: Removed the code block responsible for rendering the map loop of G2 badges in the bottom-right corner of the footer.
- **Layout Cleanup**: The remaining bottom bar elements (WA Business logo, Partner badges, Social links) remain intact.

## Verification
- **Visual Check**: Confirmed via screenshot (`footer_no_badges`) that the G2 badges are no longer visible, leaving a cleaner footer design with only the essential partner branding.
