# Task Completion Report: Pipedrive Logo Update

## Objective
Replace the Leadsquared placeholder in the Integrations Ecosystem with the official Pipedrive logo (`pipedrive.svg`) following the user's request.

## Changes Implemented
- **Pipedrive Node**: Replaced the Leadsquared (indigo dot) placeholder with the `pipedrive.svg` image in the desktop absolute positioning layout (bottom-left).
- **Mobile Grid**: Added a new entry for Pipedrive in the mobile integration list to ensure cross-device consistency.
- **Visuals**: The Pipedrive logo is now prominently displayed in a large, centered white bubble card.

## Verification
- **Visual Check**: Confirmed via screenshot (`pipedrive_logo_verification`) that the Pipedrive logo is correctly integrated and visible in the bottom-left position of the ecosystem visual.
