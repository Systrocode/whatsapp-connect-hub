# Remaining Logos to Update

Based on the current implementation in `Index.tsx`, the following integration nodes are still using placeholder colored dots and need official logos:

1.  **PayTabs** (currently a Blue dot)
2.  **Leadsquared** (currently an Indigo dot)
3.  **Klaviyo** (currently a Black dot)

*(Note: I noticed `zendesk.svg` in your logos folder, but it is not currently linked in the visual map. Let me know if you'd like to swap one of the above for Zendesk!)*
