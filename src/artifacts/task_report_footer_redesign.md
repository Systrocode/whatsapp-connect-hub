# Task Completion Report: Footer Redesign

## Objective
Revamp the footer layout to match the provided visual reference, introducing a dark theme, a "Grow Better" CTA section, and a comprehensive multi-column link structure with app store badges.

## Changes Implemented
- **"Grow Better" CTA Section**: Added a new top section with the headline "Grow Better with WA Business today" and two prominent CTA buttons ("Book a Demo", "Try for Free").
- **Dark Footer Card**: Implemented a large, rounded-corner dark container (`bg-slate-950`, `rounded-[60px]`) to house the main footer content.
- **Mega Menu Grid**: Created a 5-column grid layout containing links for Solutions, Company, Customers, Partners, Resources, Integrations, and Free Tools, matching the density of the reference design.
- **App Store Badges**: Added styled buttons for "Download on the App Store" and "Get it on Google Play" using Lucide icons.
- **Partner & Award Badges**: Included sections for Meta and Google Partner badges, as well as a row of placeholder G2 award badges (Leader, Momentum, High Performer, etc.).
- **Social & Legal**: Retained social media links and copyright notice in a clean bottom bar within the dark footer.

## Verification
- **Visual Check**: Confirmed via screenshot (`final_footer_verification`) that the new dark footer is correctly rendered, visually distinct, and densely populated layout as requested. The "Grow Better" section sits elegantly above it.
