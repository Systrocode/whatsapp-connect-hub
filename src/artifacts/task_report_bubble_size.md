# Task Completion Report: Integrations Size Increase

## Objective
Enhance the Integrations Ecosystem by significantly increasing the size of the "logo-only" integration cards to a bold, app-bubble style.

## Changes Implemented
- **Card Sizing**: Increased padding to `p-6` (was `p-5`) and corner radius to `rounded-3xl` (was `rounded-2xl`). This changes the visual from a small card to a substantial "bubble".
- **Icon Sizing**: Bumped icon sizes to `w-14 h-14` (was `w-10 h-10`) to maintain proportion with the larger cards.
- **Consistency**: Applied these changes to:
    - All Desktop Absolute Nodes.
    - Mobile Grid Cards.

## Verification
- **Visual Check**: Confirmed via screenshot (`integration_bubbles_large_logos_only`) that the section now prominently features large, app-like integration bubbles connected by the neural network lines. The design is bold and highly readable.
