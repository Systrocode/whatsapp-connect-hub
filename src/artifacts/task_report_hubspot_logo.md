# Task Completion Report: HubSpot Logo & Visual Updates

## Objective
Update the Integrations Ecosystem section to use the official HubSpot logo (`hubspot.svg`) following the user's upload, and enhance the overall visibility of integration cards.

## Changes Implemented
- **HubSpot Logo**: Replaced the placeholder orange dot for the HubSpot node with the `hubspot.svg` logo in both the desktop visualization and the mobile grid fallbacks.
- **Card Sizing**: Increased padding (`p-4`), text size (`text-base`), and icon dimensions for ALL integration nodes to make them more visible and visually balanced.
- **Mobile Grid**: Ensured the mobile layout correctly maps the new HubSpot logo file path.

## Verification
- **Visual Check**: Confirmed via screenshot (`integrations_ecosystem_verification`) that the HubSpot node now displays the official logo and that all cards are noticeably larger and clearer than the previous version.
