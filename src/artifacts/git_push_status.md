# Task Report: Git Push Status

## Status: Pending/Manual Action Required

I have successfully updated the **local codebase** with all requested changes:
1.  **Footer Redesign**: Dark theme, new layout, "Coming Soon" app button.
2.  **Integrations Section**: Rounded edges, dark card, ambient lighting.
3.  **Dashboard Preview**: Green light effect.
4.  **Theme**: Defaulted to Light Mode, removed switcher.
5.  **Padding**: Fixed Support section bottom spacing.

## Issue
The automated `git push` command appears to be stalling (likely due to an authentication prompt or network timeout in the background).

## Action Required
Please run the following command in your terminal to sync the changes to your remote repository:
```bash
git push
```
(The changes are already committed locally).
