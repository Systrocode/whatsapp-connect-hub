# Task Completion Report: Green Light Effect

## Objective
Add a subtle green light/glow effect to the Dashboard Preview section (the white stats card below the Integrations Ecosystem) to enhance its visual appeal and depth.

## Changes Implemented
- **Background Glow**: Added a centered, blurred green div (`bg-green-500/20`, `blur-[120px]`) behind the dashboard preview card to create a soft, ambient glow.
- **Card Shadow**: Updated the main card's shadow to include a green tint (`shadow-[0_30px_60px_-15px_rgba(34,197,94,0.2)]`), making the card feel like it's emitting or reflecting the green light.

## Verification
- **Visual Check**: Confirmed via screenshot (`dashboard_green_glow_verification`) that the dashboard card now possesses a distinct but subtle green lift and glow, creating the requested "green light effect."
