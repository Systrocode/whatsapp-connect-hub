# Task Completion Report: Integrations Row & Spacing Fix

## Objective
Fill the remaining vertical empty space at the bottom of the Support Section's right column to create a perfectly balanced layout with the left text column.

## Changes Implemented
- **Added Integrations Row**: Inserted a "Seamless Integration" visual block at the bottom of the right column, displaying HubSpot, Salesforce, and Zendesk integration indicators.
- **Adjusted Spacing**: Increased the top margin (`mt-10` from `mt-6`) and grid gap (`gap-6` from `gap-4`) of the metrics container.
- **Outcome**: The visual column content now extends vertically to match the height of the "Test AI Support" button on the left, filling the gap identified by the user's markup.

## Verification
- **Visual Check**: A final screenshot (`support_section_verification_final`) confirms that the bottom of the content on both sides is now aligned, resolving the "length" discrepancy thoroughly.
